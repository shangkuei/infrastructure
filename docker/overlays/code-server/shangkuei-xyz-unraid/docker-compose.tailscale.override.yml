# code-server - Tailscale Raw Override (unencrypted)
# Contains YAML syntax that cannot be encrypted (!reset)
#
# This file is used when running Tailscale-only mode to clear
# the direct port binding and network from docker-compose.override.yml
# since code-server uses network_mode: service:tailscale
#
# Usage: Only included with tailscale-only mode (make up-tailscale)

services:
  code-server:
    # Clear direct port binding when using Tailscale
    ports: !reset
    # Clear networks - using network_mode: service:tailscale instead
    networks: !reset
